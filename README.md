Objectives

Handle User Input Efficiently:

Implement the Scanner class to capture and process various types of user input, ensuring smooth interaction and handling common input issues.
Provide Multiple Functionalities:

Offer a menu-driven interface where users can choose between different operations, such as summing two numbers, printing a string, and calculating the cosine of a number.
Implement Control Flow with Switch Statements:

Use switch statements to manage program flow based on user selections, demonstrating effective use of control structures in Java.

Create a program that does the following.

1)Read by keyboard 3 options such as A, B and C.
2)When the option A is detected we will do the following:
 2.1)Call a function or method that performs the sum of two integers,
 the method "has" to return the result of the sum.
3)Option B
 3.1) Option B Call a function that receives a string and prints the string it receives (the name of a country), the function does not return anything.
4)Option C 
 4.1 )Call a function that receives an integer and returns the cosine of that value.
5)Call a print function to print the cosine result.

Which language uses the most libraries or third party packages?

The language of third-party libraries or packages using JavaScript, especially due to the large number of packages available in npm (Node Package Manager).

Questions

a) What was your motivation?
My motivation for creating this project was to practice and improve my Java programming skills, particularly in handling user input and implementing control flow structures such as switch statements. Additionally, I wanted to build a simple but interactive console application that can perform basic tasks like arithmetic operations, string handling, and mathematical calculations.

b) Why did you built this project?
I built this project to create a foundational tool that demonstrates how different programming concepts can be combined to create a functional application. It serves as a learning exercise to better understand how to work with user inputs, manage different functionalities within a single program, and ensure the application handles various cases and errors gracefully.

c) What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem of providing a simple, user-friendly interface for performing basic operations without needing a graphical user interface. It offers an easy way for users to perform arithmetic operations, print strings, and calculate mathematical functions such as the cosine of a number. It's a useful tool for beginners to understand how a command-line application can be structured and developed.

d) What did your learn?
What makes this project stand out is its simplicity and educational value. It demonstrates the effective use of Java programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and methods in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, the project is designed with user interaction in mind, offering clear instructions and handling various input cases, making it both practical and instructive. The inclusion of different types of operations within one program showcases versatility and the ability to handle multiple tasks in a single application.

e) What makes your project stand out?
Through this project, I learned to handle user input with the Scanner class in Java, solving common issues like leftover characters in the buffer. I used switch statements to control the program flow based on user choices. I also created and used methods to perform specific tasks, such as summing numbers and calculating the cosine, which taught me the importance of having modular and reusable code. Additionally, I learned to give clear instructions and handle incorrect inputs to improve the user experience. I explored Java's built-in mathematical functions and reinforced good practices in code structure and clarity.
